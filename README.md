# Cat and dog prediction with CNN using Keras
In this project I will use Cat and Dog Classification Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog.
This project was made with help of FreecodeCamp Keras with Tensorflow Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI&t=8697s.

The goal of this project:
 - practice building CNN using Keras;
 - build a VGG16 model;
 - make predictions from these models.
